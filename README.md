# My Home Assistant Configuration Files

## Introduction

This is my configuration of [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io/) home automation solution.
To ease the deployment a *Makefile* is included and allows to send the configuration files to the remote host

This also makes use of the packaging capabilities of HA https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/configuration/packages/

**Features**
------------

* Some [Security notifications]() ðŸš¨  when motion is detected or the front door has been open during absence
* An optional Home Alarm state machine build on native HA [Manual Alarm](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/manual) control panel triggering a plugable siren and playing alarm sound on a Echo Dot device 
* Media player (Amazon Echo Dot) with Text to Speech ðŸ”ˆ
* Cover management with Somfy RTS devices controlled by [Airsend Duo](https://devmel.com/fr/airsend-duo.html) - requires specific container
* System Monitoring and backup ðŸ–¥
* Arriving and leaving notifications ðŸ””
* Device tracker using ARP scan

## Usage
